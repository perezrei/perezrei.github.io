I will use the basics of html5 and ccs3 that i've learned for now. It would be a good experience to compare the results with those ones that I will achieve with the knowledge adquired her at HYF Belgium.
For now, to be honest, I find that there are a lot of things a little bit confusing, there is a whole bunch of new information and different opinions to get the same results, ones harder than the others :sweat: but is fine, it's part of the procces of learning to discover new paths to solve new situations.

This is one of my favorite pictures I'd like to share with my familiy, friends and the HYFbe family:
